      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <p>It's dead simple right?</p>
      <p>It's going to be a 4v4, 5v5, 6v6?</p>
      <p>It will be played on a field, hopefully. Visualize it as capture the flag and larping combined</p>

      <h2>LET's GET READY TO RUMBLE</h2>
      <p>so at some point on December 6th around 3pm or 3:30 we will be showing up to a field perhaps Donelly Field at York St & Berkshire St, Cambridge, MA 02141 </p>
      <p>We will be split into two teams, the Guy Fawkes and the Foxes. Why? Because I said so, also I thought they sorted sounded the same and guy fawkes masks are readily available on amazon. But don't worry! This isn't an anonymous meetup</p>
      <p>The field will be split into two halves, classic capture the flag methodology, each team will go to a side after having gotten their respective gear/balloon(s)</p>
      <p>There are 3 different win conditions, so far:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
          <p>Move the oppositions' yoga ball over half without your hands or feet coming into contact with the ball</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Pop the oppositions' SPECIAL three balloons, maybe I'll write special on 'em, make it real obvious </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          
          <p>Carry the oppositions' golden egg on the provided silver spoon with either Neil's or Tom's name on it across half. Eight ball pool rules: you break it your team loses</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All right you with me so far? Really? Come closer child...</p>
      <p>As of the time of writing this there are 4? different potential roles/classes- this is wear we get into the larping aspect, hahaha I didn't even intend that lol. Every person is going to get at least one biodegreable balloon to attach to themselves</p>
      <h3>classes (min-max number of available)</h3>
          <p> archers- (0-5) you will get a bow and three arrows and a stubby pool noodle bit for when you potshots run out of arrows. Also finders keepers? Pick up the arrows if/when you want. GET OUT THERE AND POP SOME BALLOONS!!!</p>
          <p>spearman- (0-4) you get a full pool noodle giving you that oh so sweet reach, throw it, spear someone with it, go nuts!</p>
          <p>swordsman- (0-4)you get slightly less than half a noodle and maybe a shield thing in the form of a pizza box</p>
          <p>mage- (0-2) oh so you've chosen chaos eh? I don't blame you...the universe, entropy, having a wild time! You will get two foam dice that you can peg others with, when pegged the peggee haha must succumb to the 'weighted' outcome of the roll such as 'steal balloon', 'pop balloon', 'give balloon'? ruh roh</p>
          <p>healer-(tbd) this class is still on the cutting board. We can debate it's inclusion in the forum section. You get 4 FOUR BALLOONS and no weapons. BUT but you're the only person who can inflate balloons for your jailed teammates when their balloons get popped</p>

    <section id="rules">
      <h2>rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          
          <p>Rule one, we don't talk about rules.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Rule 2- see rule one
        </li>
        <li>
          General rule- pop the opposition's balloons, steal the opposition's golden egg, snipe those special balloons, use that pool noodle like a hockey stick to whack the yoga ball. oh no, your balloon popped? STRAIGHT TO JAIL!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>TEAM SELECTION</h2>
      <p>a general note- it's easier to change classes than change teams are that'd require a costume change</p>
